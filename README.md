# Machine-learning-exercises

Machine learning exercises from google machine learning recipes

important things to consider (from ML recipe #3):

1) Make sure features aren't duplicated e.g. height in inches and height in centimeters
2) Make sure your features are easy to understand
3) Try to figure out the best features to use which will help you classify correctly
4) try to avoid useless features as they can mess up your data sets
